# Clash-Royale-Analytics
using clashroyale api to get some stats for myself and some friends
using timestamps, wins, and losses, i can get my winrate over a certain history as long as it was recorded in here
to start a new database, just delete the old one and a filenotfound will be caught and a new csv will be created
json web tokens bound to specific ips but whitelist can be updated
