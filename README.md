# Clash-Royale-Analytics
using clashroyale api to get some stats for myself and some friends
using timestamps, wins, and losses, i can get my winrate over a certain history as long as it was recorded in here


to add new players, just add them in the players list in main.py. to restart a database, just delete the file and then a new one will be created automatically
